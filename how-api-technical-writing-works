##What is API?

Let's start with what an API is. 
API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
The application can be any software that performs a specific task and the interface is a point where two applications communicate.

One application acts as a client and the other acts as a server. 
A client asks for some resource, for example a file, and the server sends that file to the client.

The client can be your desktop or laptop computer, mobile phone, or any device you use to connect to the internet. 
And the server is a bigger computer that stores the data you want (a file in our case).
