# About me

My name is Kyle Laffoon and I've been in Technical Writing and Documentation for over 15 years. I am passionate about accuracy and inclusion. I create documentation and training that helps audiences of various backgrounds or of differing approaches to research. I include all subject matter experts and developers in friendly discussion of processes/materials to ensure full understanding.

I’ve led teams of up to 20 before and I am always friendly and approachable. I actively seek to identify and solve problems and am very quick to understand new technical concepts.

## Experience

I have supported several fintech and cloud computing companies such as:

- American Express
- Alkami Technology
- JP Morgan Chase
- Fidelity Investments


At American Express, I supported their UX Developer teams in docuementing API updates and standard documentation, like API Authentication and Authorization Best Practices.

At Alkami Technology, I was responsible for the SDK and API products’ documentation and training. I monitored all incoming comments on the Documentation and Training discussion group and engaged the clients in solutions specific to their current needs.

I also have experience in instruction writing/editing, single source documentation in FrameMaker and Robohelp, proposal presentation and web page design. I have also designed and taught classes to different skill levels, based on identified need.  I have completed an Associate's degree in Technical Communication with emphasis in Technical Writing.
